    <p>I will share with you a bit about my flow.</p>
    <!--Talk about first flow: Drawing and painting.-->

    <p>I see myself as more of an artistic person and I've always been drawn to visual arts because that is how I can best express my creativity. I specifically enjoy drawing and painting and love using a variety of different mediums such as... </p>

    <ul>
        <li>pencils</li>
        <li>watercolor/ watercolor pencils</li>
        <li>acrylic (although, I don't use this as often)</li>
        <li>pen and ink </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/art mediums.jpg" alt="Various different art mediums." width=50% height=50%>

    <p>I would have to say watercolor is my favorite medium because of the pretty cool effects it creates when being blended together. Sometimes, all that I have at hand are pencils and that does the job when I am in the mood to sketch something. I can immerse
        myself in the shading process as I like to take my time and get the details correct to highlight every aspect my artwork and make the whole piece pop! Even though I'm not the best at art, I'm very proud of the significant improvement I've made
        over the years with various different techniques and details captured. </p>

    <!--Second flow-->
    <h2>D.I.Y.</h2>
    <p> I also love working on various different DIY arts pojects that are new to me. For example, I tried different embroidering techniques on a bucket hat once! I also tried crocheting over the summer which I found super relaxing and satisfying as my work
        slowly grew. </p>
